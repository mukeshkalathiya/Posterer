## Posterer's Origins ##

It's handy to have an app that you can use to fire off HTTP transactions at services - Like a web browser for example. But browsers are driven by HTML, and for testing Web Services (i.e. SOAP) you need finer grain control. On Firefox, there is the Poster plug-in. I've used this a lot and it's been very useful. 

As the authentication and authorization requirements for hitting web services increase, Poster is showing it's age. I needed more power and my finger tips, so I started writing a poster-er. Ahd here it is. Posterer.
